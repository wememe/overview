# WeMeme
Welcome to WeMeme, a place where friends meme and earn together.

## What is WeMeme?
WeMeme is a project where content creators share their creativity to collaboratively make memes together and earn when they are sold.

## How Do We Make Memes?
Memes are made in three collaborative steps.
1. First user uploads an image and buys shares in the meme. Begin a new meme here: https://wememe.world/upload
2. Second user draws on the image and buys shares in the meme. Draw on memes here: https://wememe.world/draw
3. Third user captions the image and buys shares in the meme. Caption memes here: https://wememe.world/caption

## How Do We Price Memes?
After each step of the creation process, the contributor of that step is required to buy shares in the meme to signal their contribution and support for the idea, and they can buy as many shares as they like. The eventual list price of a meme is related to the number of shares purchsased in the meme by its creators throughout the creation process â€“ so the more shares purchased by contributors, the higher the list price.

#### Bonding Curves
Meme shares are priced according to a linear bonding curve. This means that the initial meme contributor (the creator that uploads the first image) will receive the cheaper shares than the drawing contributor, who will receive cheaper shares than the captioning contributor. There is no limit to how many shares a contributor is allowed to purchase.

## How Do We Buy Memes?
After the third contributor captions the meme and finished buying their shares, the meme is automatically listed for sale on our site. The list price is determined according to the number of shares that have been purchased by the contributors.

## Business Model
We collect a 3% fee from the sale price for creating and maintaining the platform.

## Who is it for?
WeMeme is an inclusive, collaborative platform that invites all curious creators to #buidl memes together. However at this time to use WeMeme you need a web3-enabled browser and Ether.

## Project Goals
* Create a user-friendly bonding curve implementation
* Create a project that unites the Ethereum community
* Integrate 3Box Profiles and Profile Hover
* Have fun

## How did we build it?
We built WeMeme in 36 hours during the ETH Denver hackathon and community event largely using open source software. Built with ðŸ’– at ETHDenver.


### Open Source Web3 Libraries

#### Application Base | 3Box Dapp
We used the 3Box dapp as a starting point for our web application. We used the base application software, which included all of the required web3 handling. The 3Box Dapp codebase also provided us with image upload capability.
